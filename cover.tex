\opening{Dear Editorial Board,}

We submit to you our manuscript for review.  It details a method for anomaly detection in
extreme value data, based on the distribution of the angular component of same.  This method
is then extended to include a categorical data model, using the latent distribution of class
probabilities.  We explore the efficacy of our methods on several canonical datasets,
as well as comparing against canonical methods of anomaly detection.

The contribution here is three-fold: first, density-based anomaly scores computed by modelling the
angular distribution of extreme data is relatively untrodden ground.  Second, the categorical data
model, using a BNP mixture of Dirichlet-categoricals, provides an extremely flexible means of
fitting such data.   Finally, We look at methods of linking these regimes: anomaly scores reflective of
both the angular and categorical components of a mixed data vector.

This work was completed in 

Sincerely,
