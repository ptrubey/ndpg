Anomaly detection, describes a field of methods for identifying observations as \emph{anomalous}.
    This classification requires some explanation as to \emph{what} defines an observation as anomalous.
    For this paper, following the general trend of literature, we define anomalies
    as observations that are in some manner \emph{different} than non-anomalous data. We interpret this to
    say that anomalies were not generated according to the same generating distribution as non-anomalous data,
    and as such, we would expect observations found in regions of relative data sparsity to be more likely to be
    anomalous those observations found in regions of high data abundance.
    Equivalent names for this field include \emph{outlier} detection---observations lying outside the
    distribution of non-anomalous data, and \emph{novelty} detection---\makenote{rewrite; observations
    for which the distribution is functionally different than that of the observed data}.  Some authors will
    distinguish the last by the assumption of a \emph{clean} training data set containing no anomalies.  Such
    an assumption produces the interpretation that anomalies contain information that has not been seen before,
    hence they are novelties.

The applicability of extreme value theory to anomaly detection is predicated on the assumption that
  extreme observations are more likely to be anomalous.  A discussion on this point is provided by \cite{goix2017},
  stating that extreme observations exist at the border between anomalous and non-anomalous regions.  Indeed,
  for most of the datasets in our testing, the probability of This
  relative abundance of anomalies among extremes might As such,
  a naive model that does not take into account the nature of extremes will be more likely to classify all
  extremes.  
  
  
  \cite{goix2017} provides a discussion to
  this effect, that extreme observations exist at the border between anomalous and non-anomalous regions.
  \makenote{This should be rewritten.  Data from example cases indicate the relative probability of anomalous
  data in the training set (extremes) is higher than in the general data for most sets; indicating anomalous data
  are more likely to be extreme than normal data.  But just because data is extreme does not make it anomalous,
  so a detection method that focuses on extremes is important.}
  
  In our testing, 

For our purpose, we do not assume the existence of labels in the training dataset, and seek an
  algorithm that can produce anomaly scores in an absence of class labels. As such, we will offer
  a brief overview of unsupervised anomaly detection methods, as well as discussion of the methods
  we are preparing here as competing models.
