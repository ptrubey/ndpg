\section{Introduction}

%\makenote{Introduce basic extreme value theory, to be expanded in the next section.}

%\makenote{Expand upon relevance of anomaly detection in the context of extreme value theory}.

Anomaly detection, describes a field of methods for identifying observations as \emph{anomalous}.
    For this paper, following the general trend of literature, we define anomalies as observations
    that are in some manner \emph{different} than non-anomalous data.
    Equivalent names for this field include \emph{outlier} detection---observations lying outside the
    distribution of non-anomalous data, and \emph{novelty} detection---observations
    for which the distribution is functionally different than that of the observed data.
