% A fundamental result of multivariate extreme value theory is independence
%     in distribution between the angular component and radial component of an
%     extreme observation.  We make use of this independence to develop an 
%     anomaly detection algorithm that separates the \emph{anomaly score} into 
%     independent angular and radial scores.  These scores are then developed
%     separately as functions of calculated density.  We induce applicability of
%     EVT in real data by considering the peaks-over-threshold regime,
%     transforming only data in excess of a large threshold to be standard 
%     multivariate Pareto.

% To fit an angular density, we project the angular component onto 
%     $\mathbb{S}_p^{d-1}$ and fit a Bayesian non-parametric model implementing 
%     projected gamma as the kernel density. This works well for fitting a model, 
%     but density estimation for use in anomaly scores is unstable.
%     Instead, we use the fitted model to generate a posterior predictive sample, 
%     and make use of non-parametric density estimation algorithms on that sample
%     to compute anomaly scores.  We offer two such angular scores, based on the 
%     $k$-nearest neighbors, and kernel density estimation algorithms 
%     respectively.

% We further expand the applicability of our approach by implementing a 
%     categorical data model, making use of Dirichlet-multinomial as the kernel 
%     density.  We then adapt the posterior predictive density scores developed 
%     for the angular data model to the categorical data model.

% Finally, we combine the regimes to create a \emph{mixed} data model.  We further
%     adapt the scores developed in the angular and categorical data models to the
%     mixed data regime.  We analyze the performance of our methods in the 
%     categorical and mixed data regimes.  Additionally, we investigate the 
%     standard Pareto rank-ordered transformation, which expands the applicability
%     of our method to all real-valued data, not only that in excess of a 
%     threshold.

% We find anomaly scores developed in our methods to perform generally better than
%     the canonical methods we tested.

We develop anomaly detection scores leveraging the independence between the radial 
    and angular components of vectors in extreme value settings.
    The angular density is modeled as a Bayesian non-parametric mixture of 
    projected gammas.  The resulting posterior predictive density is used
    for the angular score. For flexible categorical data modeling, we develop 
    an extension of  the projected gammas model using a Dirichlet-multinomial 
    kernel. This is coupled with our  proposed anomaly detection  score in 
    mixed data settings. We evaluate  the anomaly detection  efficacy of 
    our proposed scores and find that  they are generally superior to tested 
    canonical methods.
