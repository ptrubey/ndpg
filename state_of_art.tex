\subsection{Current trends of extreme value theory in novelty detection}
The intersection of extreme value theory and anomaly detection is a current topic
    of research.  Some methods employ EVT on densities estimated through other
    means, such as \cite{clifton2011} using a Gaussian Mixture model, and \cite{gu2021}
    using a Gaussian process, then both employ EVT on the estimated densities to
    establish a decision threshold.  In this manner, they avoid setting the threshold heuristically.

\cite{goix2017} employs a theoretical argument from EVT to establish a threshold
    such that it partitions the space $[1,\infty)^d$ into $\alpha$-cones, where 
    $\alpha$ indicates which dimensions exceed the threshold.  It then submits 
    real data to the standard Pareto transformation,
    $T(x) = \frac{1}{1 - \hat{F}(x)}$, and bins the data according to which 
    $\alpha$-cone it falls in.  $\alpha$-cones with few observations are analogous
    to lower-density regions, so observations falling into these cones are considered
    more likely to be anomalous.
